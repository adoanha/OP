                        <h2>Why Watch One Piece?</h2>
                        <p><b>One Piece</b> on the surface level is a story about romanticized adventure. To travel the sea and become, what the main protagonists strives to be, <i>The Pirate King.</i> To become the pirate king means to be the freest person, never to be confined by anyone or any organization. But as you get deeper into the series, <b>One Piece</b> starts to become an almagamation of various aspects of life such as forming a tight knit group of friends to having a balance between political powers. You'll meet compelling characters, in and out of the crew with great character design. The universe is extremely vast and unique with many islands inspired by real places such as Italy or Egypt. <b>One Piece</b> is thematically diverse, expressing ideas like racism, slavery, and political maneuvering. The story is so vast it has almost 1,000 chapters and you would think that it would get contrived and convuluted. Yet, the writer <i>Eiichiro Oda</i> manages to keep the story extremely consistent. Though it is a long journey, it is a journey well worth taking. Just sit back and enjoy the ride!</p>
